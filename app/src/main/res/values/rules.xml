No other materials are permitted. The wooden sticks can be cut to fit as desired.The amount of sticks used in the bridge is limited only by the Dimensions and Weight restrictions.</li>\n              <li>Please note the following when you design and build your bridge:</li>\n              <li>During the strengthâ€“test of the bridge, one horizontal bar will be placed on the road deck of the bridge. A downward force will be applied onto the horizontal bar. By placing the bar on the deck in this manner, we ensure that the truss members of the bridge are stressed during the strength test. The builder of the model bridge shall ensure that there is one 3cm X 3cm opening,through the side of the bridge structure, immediately beside the bridge deck, to accommodate the load testing.</li>\n              <li>The self weight of the bridge must be less than 250gms. If the above mentioned limit is crossed then points will be deducted as per the following: up to 5gms over limit\u2013for each 1gmsâ€“ 0.5 point will be deducted. 5â€“10 gms over limit\u2013for each gm, 1 point will be deducted. 10 and above over limit\u2013for each 1gmsâ€“1.5points will be deducted.</li>\n              <li>2 points will deducted from the score if the bridge deck is narrower than 3cm.</li>\n              <li>5 points will be deducted for each 1cm (or portion there of) that the bridge\'s height exceeds 18cm.</li>\n              <li>2 point will be deducted for each 1cm that the bridge\'s width exceeds 14cm.</li>\n              <li>2 point will be deducted for each 1cm that the bridge\'s length exceeds 60cm.</li>\n              <li>Entries will be disqualified if they use a material other than fevicol and wooden popsicle sticks.</li>\n              <li>Entries will be disqualified if the bridge length is shorter than 50cm.</li>\n              <li>Entries will be disqualified if the height of the bridge is less than one popsicle stick.</li>\n              <li>Entries will be disqualified if there is evidence of heat treating(baking, etc).</li>\n              <li>Suspension Bridge Model is not permitted in this event.</li>\n              <li>Entries will be disqulified if the bridge width is shorter than 10cm.</li>\n              <li>Entries will be disqualified if there is no road on the bridge.</li>\n              <li>Construction: 4 hours</li>\n              <li>Load Test Outcome: Load Testing will be conducted on the 3rd event day</li>\n              <li>The bridges will be sbjected to a Efficiencyâ€“test in which a downward force will be applied to the bridge and the force will be gradually increased until the bridge fails. This force will be recorded on the Evaluation Sheet.A bridge is considered to fail when at least one member of the bridge breaks. During the test, the bridge will rest on two blocks placed apart.These blocks are loose and will resist the downward force applied to the bridge. The Strength Factor will be computed using the formula: Efficiency=(applied force)/(self weight of the bridge)</li>\n              <li>The bridge with the highest Strength Factor will be given a score of 100. All other bridge entries with in the category will be given a score less than 100, based on the ratio of their Strength Factor score to the highest Strength Factor score.</li>\n              <li>Decisions taken by Judges will be Final</li>\n            </ul>\n            <h3>Specifications</h3>\n            <ul>\n              <li>The length of the bridge must be between 50 cm and 60cm at its base.

Height of a zero member will not be considered.</li>\n              <li>The weight of the bridge shall not exceed 250 gms. \" Weight means weight, including stick, glue and inclues all attachments submitted with the bridge. Penalties will be assessed against overweight bridges.\"</li>\n            </ul>\n            <h3>Scoring Rules</h3>\n            <ul>\n              <li>Keep the glued joints cleaned and trimmed. At the joints, be sure to overlap the sticks and wipe off excess glue.</li>\n              <li>If the edges of the bridge are intended to be straight, use a straight edge while building the bridge.</li>\n              <li>Try to use some artistic imagination</li>\n              <li>Try to use engineering principles, to transfer the force from the middle of the bridge to its supports.</li>\n              <li>Comply with the Weights and Dimensions restrictions to avoid penalties.</li>\n            </ul>]]></string>
